# SickSkill — A 30-Day Angular Skill Mastery Project

> A hands-on 30-day Angular challenge to master RxJS, architecture, testing, and advanced tools — built as a scalable Skill Tracker Dashboard. Designed for future integration with [Jobang](https://github.com/itshimanshu010/jobang), a career platform for freshers.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Sharpen Angular skills in a structured, daily format
- Build a real project while learning (not toy apps)
- Apply best practices: modular architecture, RxJS, Jasmine testing, Angular CDK, CLI, performance optimization, and more
- Showcase work publicly on GitHub and LinkedIn
- Eventually evolve into a feature module of **Jobang** (e.g., Admin Panel, Skill Tracker, CMS)
